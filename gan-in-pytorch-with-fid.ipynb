GANs are one of my favorite neural networks and one of the biggest pain points was assesing it's performance as precisely as we can do for other neural networks. Knowing when to stop the training(reaching Nash equilbirium) or comparing two GAN models was never straightforward. This drawback is overcomed by using Fretchet Inception Distance which is also considered superior to it's predecessor Inception Score.  \n","\n","FID was introduced in the paper [GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium\n","](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500)\n","\n","I have picked up the underlying DCGAN implementation from this [Pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) and have iteratively improved upon it by some hacks discussed later and compared performance between experiments using FID which I'll also discuss later in the kernel."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f6180422-a419-47ed-acbc-93c9b0722cc2","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"f7601d03-a483-410b-b136-e2fd99bb0c9a","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-10T05:47:39.521387Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-10T05:47:39.521057Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-10T05:47:40.585582Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-10T05:47:40.584749Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-10T05:47:39.521323Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# cifar10-python\n","\n","from numba import jit, cuda\n","\n","from __future__ import print_function\n","import argparse\n","import os\n","import random\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.nn.parallel\n","import torch.backends.cudnn as cudnn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import torch.utils.data\n","import torchvision.datasets as dset\n","import torchvision.transforms as transforms\n","import torchvision.utils as vutils\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import torchvision.models as models\n","import matplotlib.animation as animation\n","from IPython.display import HTML\n","\n","from scipy import linalg\n","from torch.nn.functional import adaptive_avg_pool2d\n","\n","from PIL import Image\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import sys\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","# print(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n","\n","import time\n","\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"071615f4-7c98-455c-a27f-ba371b6f2aea","_uuid":"e7613a30-7540-40a4-acfd-246e54d46490","trusted":true},"source":["## Generative Adversarial Networks\n","A quick recap in case you don't know about GANs.\n","\n","> * GANs are a class of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms that implement deep neural networks and are comprised of two parts(networks), pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”).
